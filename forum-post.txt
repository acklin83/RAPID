[B]RAPID v2.6 — Recording Auto-Placement & Intelligent Dynamics[/B]

Hey everyone,

I've been working on a workflow tool that I think a lot of mix engineers here might find useful, and I wanted to share it.

[B]The problem[/B]

If you mix for other people, you know the drill: someone sends you their recording session as an .rpp file, and you need to get all those tracks into your mix template — the one with your carefully set up routing, FX chains, sends, groups, and automation. You end up manually dragging tracks around, relinking media, losing your FX... it's tedious, error-prone, and eats into actual mixing time.

That's what RAPID solves.

[B]What it does[/B]

RAPID maps recording tracks from a source .rpp to your mix template in seconds. You load the source RPP, it auto-matches tracks using fuzzy matching (handles typos, abbreviations, naming variations), you verify/adjust the mapping, hit commit — and your template is populated with all media items while preserving every FX chain, send, routing path, and automation lane you had set up.

[B]Multi-RPP Import — the big one[/B]

This is where it gets interesting. If you work on projects with multiple recording sessions — live albums, multi-day sessions, episodic content — you can import [I]multiple[/I] RPP files into the same template:

[LIST]
[*]Each RPP gets its own region (auto-named from filename)
[*]Tempo maps and time signatures from all sessions are merged correctly
[*]Markers are imported with proper offsets
[*]Configurable gap between sessions (in measures)
[*]Drag-and-drop reordering of the RPP queue
[*]Column-based mapping UI with per-RPP dropdowns
[/LIST]

I spent a lot of time getting the tempo handling right — everything is time-based (seconds), so complex sessions with tempo changes, time signature switches, and linear ramps all merge cleanly.

[B]LUFS Normalization[/B]

Built-in LUFS-based normalization with instrument-specific profiles. You can set different target levels for kick, snare, vocals, bass — whatever makes sense for your workflow. It uses segment-based measurement with percentile filtering so a single loud transient doesn't throw off your reading.

There's also a calibration system: select a reference item that sounds right to you, measure it, and RAPID creates a profile from that. Works great for building your own gain staging presets.

[B]Other features[/B]

[LIST]
[*][B]Drag & drop[/B] — drag .rpp and audio files straight from your file manager onto the RAPID window
[*][B]Live template sync[/B] — add/remove/rename tracks in your template while RAPID is open, mappings update automatically
[*][B]Custom aliases[/B] — teach the matcher that "Vox" = "Lead Vocal", "KD" = "Kick Drum", etc.
[*][B]Protected tracks[/B] — lock tracks you don't want touched
[*][B]Editable names[/B] — double-click to rename template destinations
[*][B]Duplicate slots[/B] — map multiple source tracks to the same destination (with independent naming)
[*][B]Lane alignment[/B] — imported items placed on fixed lanes for easy A/B comparison
[/LIST]

[B]Requirements[/B]

[LIST]
[*]REAPER 6.0+
[*]ReaImGui (via ReaPack)
[*]SWS Extension (recommended)
[*]JS_ReaScriptAPI (optional, for multi-file dialogs)
[/LIST]

[B]Feedback welcome[/B]

This has been a passion project for the past few months and it's become a core part of my own mixing workflow. I'd love to hear from anyone who tries it — what works, what doesn't, what's missing. If you hit a bug or have a feature idea, drop it here or open an issue on GitHub.

Cheers,
Frank
